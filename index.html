          <h5 class="heading2">More info</h5>
          <p id="more-info">Ashley Jessica Ancheta, commonly goes by "AJ", recieved her Bachelor of Science in biology and chemistry at Northern Arizona University. AJ moved to Portland, OR 3 years ago to embark on a career in medicine. To obtain hours for graduate school, she  volunteered as an EMT and worked as a <span class="links"><a href="https://www.scribe-x.com/">lead medical scribe</a></span>.</p>
          <h5 class="heading2">Hobbies</h5>
          <p id="more-info">AJ is first and foremost a dog mom to a mutt named "Kenny" and loves cruising with him all day everyday. When she is not coding, she tries her best to get outdoors rain or shine. In between those activities, she trains <span class="links"><a href="http://www.nemesisbjj.com/">jiu-jitsu</a></span> regularly and has been training for about 3 years now. Okay, lets play!</p>

          <h5 class="heading2">Why programming?</h5>
          <p id="more-info">During her time as a medical scribe, she often worked with various types of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs)and found that some EMRs are not that user friendly. She found an interest in their software development and is curious on ways to improve those applications for a better user experience.</p>
          <h5 class="heading2">Goals in programming</h5>
          <p id="more-info">Programing can be intimidating to someone who has never worked in the tech industry before, but AJ is willing to be open to learning and collaborating with others.</p>
